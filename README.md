What will social interactions look like tomorrow or in the future? The current turbulent time resulted in so many changes in our lives: from zoom classes to virtual cocktail parties to online workouts. Can you still recall what life was like pre-pandemic? Do you find yourself constantly facing the screen during pandemic? Have you ever wondered what communication will look like post-pandemic?

The aim of our website is to help you examine yourself through an interview-styled Q&A session. We hope you will keep these questions at the back of your mind when you start reflecting: Are you talking with another person? Is it genuine? Does that still hold true when you are confronted with a recording of yourself? One main goal for our website is to reiterate the effects and the feelings caused by surveillance, thus we emphasized that “you will be recorded” on our page. Visually, we used glitches and blurs to represent distortion — glitching reveals the distortion of self and presentation, while blurriness highlights the distortion of intent, clarity of communication and confidence of received message.

Now, sit back and start to contemplate who you are.
