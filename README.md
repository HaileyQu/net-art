What will social interactions look like tomorrow or in the future? The current turbulent time resulted in so many changes in our lives: from zoom classes to virtual cocktail parties to online workouts. Can you still recall what life was like pre-pandemic? Do you find yourself constantly facing the screen during pandemic? Have you ever wondered what communication will look like post-pandemic?

The aim of our website is to help you examine yourself through an interview-styled Q&A session. We hope you will keep these questions at the back of your mind when you start reflecting: Are you talking with another person? Is it genuine? Does that still hold true when you are confronted with a recording of yourself? Another goal for our website is to reiterate the effects and the feelings caused by surveillance, thus we emphasized that “you will be recorded” on our page. Even as you spend a personal moment reflecting on your internet presence, you are being watched and information about you is being collected (we try to bring your awareness to this with popups and the terms and conditions you accept). Visually, we used glitches and blurs to represent distortion — glitching reveals the distortion of self and presentation, while blurriness highlights the distortion of intent, clarity of communication and confidence of received message.

Now, sit back and start to contemplate who you are.

Note - After clicking on Accept you will be taken to to the interview-style Q&A, once you click on Start Recording. You must click on Stop Recording whenever you are finished with the interview, and you can watch yourself answer the questions. We hope in this moment, you see yourself as others see you now, and you can reflect on how human you are in this setting.

Important - using the speech recognition api in this experience requires you to
say something before clicking on start recording and accepting microphone and
camera use twice. You should see your input processed as your output will be
displayed on the footer in flashing letters.
